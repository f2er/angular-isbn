# angular-isbn v0.1.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/janantala/angular-isbn.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/janantala/angular-isbn)

ISBN number validation for AngularJS

# Testing

We use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in `test/test.config.js`
